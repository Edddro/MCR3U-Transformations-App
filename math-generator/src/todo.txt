- mess up the equation: have the c value in front of the a values at times or have the k value unfactored
- have a section where users input coordinates and it will display valid points or invalid points based on the parent function
- show the steps to do the transformation from start to finish
    - this should show the steps to make the formula look like g(x) = af[k(x - d)]+ c if not already
    - generate 5 points that support the parent function
    - show the mapping statement: (x,y) --> (x/k + d, ay+c) and sub in the generated points
    - show the displayed points
- add a graph for the user's points or the generated points
- use LaTeX for the ui and make the ui/ux better
