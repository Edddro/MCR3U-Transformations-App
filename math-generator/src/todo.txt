- have a section where users input coordinates and it will display valid points or invalid points based on the parent function
- show the steps to do the transformation from start to finish
    - generate 5 points that support the parent function
    - fix the transformation steps to reciprocate the k value if less than 0 and not equal to -1
    - show the displayed points
- Generate bigger numbers for sine and cosine
- fix the random rerrangement to only run when the equation is regenerated
- add a graph for the user's points or the generated points
- clean the code for generating numbers
- make the ui/ux better
